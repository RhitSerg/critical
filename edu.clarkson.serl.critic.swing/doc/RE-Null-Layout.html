	<h1>Null Layout</h1>
	<p>
		I see you are using <tt>null</tt> layout for a container created in your code 
		[<a href="code:-CLASS-:-LINE-">Take Me There</a>]. 
		
		For any widget to be displayed, it must have a size and location determined somehow.
		One way to do this is by directly calling <tt>JComponenet.setBounds()</tt> or <tt>JComponent.setSize()</tt> and
		<tt>JComponent.setLocation()</tt> on the component in a container managed without a layout manager 
		(<tt>JPanel.setLayout(null)</tt>). Alternatively, the size and location of widgets can be calculated
		automatically using an algorithm, which is also known as LayoutManger. 
		
		The consequences of using absolute layout are:
		<ol>
		<li><b>Resizability: </b>The widgets managed by absolute layout will remain in its original size and location when the frame is resized.</li>
		<li><b>Portability: </b>The GUI may not look the same in different platforms.</li>
		</ol> 
	</p>
